     <p>A Kerala youth who died in Thrissur on Saturday had tested 
        positive for monkeypox abroad, state Health Minister Veena
         George said on Sunday.

        <span class="mark text-dark"> 22-year-old youth, a native of Punniyoor in Thrissur, died at
        a private hospital in Thrissur</span>, days after he returned from 
        the UAE. The government said that while the results of the test
        done in the UAE confirmed the presence of the monkeypox virus,
         a probe would be conducted to ascertain the cause of death.

      “The youth had no symptoms of monkeypox. He had been admitted to 
      a hospital with symptoms of encephalitis and fatigue. His relatives
      handed over the test result only on Saturday. A high-level probe 
      would be held into the death as monkeypox has a very low fatality
      rate,’’ said the minister.
